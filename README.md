# Data-Vis

I did a simple data visualization of African women's shelter entrants' average age, sorted by case type and their religion.  From this we can tell that, far more Muslim women end up at a shelter due to violence, while none in this data set ended up at a shelter due to rape.  FGM and other is common amoung both religions and pagans, although FGM is most common for pagans and least common for them.
